# Flutter Commercial Roadmap
Laszlo11.dev

As a contributor to the Flutter ecosystem, I do not have a Commercial Roadmap on my own. However, I would like a strong and shiny future for Flutter, so I propose including these ideas in the Big Flutter Roadmap.
# Adoption
## Commitment
Google has a long track record of killing its products. The clickbait of “killing Flutter” is present in all related media. 

-> Google and other for-profit players should make a long-term and strong commitment to Dart/Flutter.  For example, executing this roadmap could be a good commitment indicator.
## Enterprise
Rumor says that Flutter is not widely adopted in the enterprise sector. That’s a serious problem affecting the reputation of the whole ecosystem, bringing down the job market expectations.

There are several options to improve the situation, -> for example somehow bundling Flutter with existing enterprise-friendly products.
## North America
It is also said that Flutter is more popular in the Rest of the World than in North America. 
One of the issues is the quality of the non-native English video tutorials. -> Google, please.
## Developers
The Flutter developer community is excellent, brilliant, and loyal till the end -> Prove that it’s not the end.

Newcomers are not so determined: “Should I learn Flutter? Will I find a job?” -> Commitment and Enterprise 

-> Create a multilevel, achievable Flutter/Dart certification system.

# User and developer experience
## Platform consistency
The best promise of Flutter is multiplatform. So, we should deliver it. Really.

-> All platform inconsistencies must be solved, no matter if they are part of the history,
## Technical debt
Flutter and Dart are in good shape. There are performance issues, missing 3D, whatever, but nothing showstopper.

-> To eliminate the debt, we should go backward: solve everything that may disturb end-users, decision-makers, app developers, contributors, and finally, Dash.
# Package ecosystem
_Still to come_
# Technology
There are brilliant minds already focusing on Flutter/Dart technology improvements. 
Just let them work.
